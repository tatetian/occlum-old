# Demos

This directory contains sample projects that demonstrate how Occlum can be used to build and run user applications.

## Toolchain demos

This set of demos shows how the Occlum toolchain can be used with different build tools.

* [hello_c](hello_c/): A sample C project built with Makefile/CMake.
* [hello_cc](hello_cc/): A sample C++ project built with Makefile/CMake.
* [hello_bazel](hello_bazel/): A sample C++ project built with [Bazel](https://bazel.build).

## Application demos

This set of demos shows how real-world apps can be easily run inside SGX enclaves with Occlum.

* [https_server](https_server/): A HTTPS file server based on [Mongoose Embedded Web Server Library](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose).
* [grpc](grpc/): A client and server communicating through [gRPC](https://grpc.io/).
* [openvino](openvino/) A benchmark of [OpenVINO Inference Engine](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/2019_R3/_docs_IE_DG_inference_engine_intro.html).
* [python](python/) A demo of [Python](https://www.python.org).
* [sqlite](sqlite/) A demo of [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) SQL database engine.
* [tensorflow_lite](tensorflow_lite/): A demo and benchmark of [Tensorflow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) inference engine.
* [xgboost](xgboost/): A demo of [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Other demos

* [embedded_mode](embedded_mode/): A cross-enclave memory throughput benchmark enabled by the embedded mode of Occlum.
* [gdb_support](gdb_suppport/): This demo explains the technical detail of GDB support and demonstrates how to debug an app running upon Occlum with GDB.
* [local_attestation](local_attestation/): This project demonstrates how an app running upon Occlum can perform SGX local attestation.
* [remote_attestation](remote_attestation/): This project demonstrates how an app running upon Occlum can perform SGX remote attestation.
